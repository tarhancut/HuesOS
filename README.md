# Хуесос

**HuesOS** is an x86_64 microkernel operating system written in Rust,
inspired by Google Zircon (Fuchsia). It boots exclusively via UEFI (via
Limine) and has a **real, verified boot-to-userspace pipeline**: it loads
via Limine, sets up paging/heap/SMP-aware scheduler, loads a ring3 ELF
process, and that process performs actual `syscall` instructions to
exercise VMOs and Channel IPC — including multi-core bring-up under QEMU
`-smp 2`.

## Status: MVP + SMP

This is still a minimum viable microkernel, not a production OS. It proves
out the full pipeline end-to-end with no stubs in the paths it exercises.
SMP (INIT-SIPI-SIPI, per-CPU GDT/TSS/IDT/scheduler, LAPIC timer, load
balance) is now verified in QEMU. Scope remains intentionally narrow —
see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) and
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

## Verified Working

- ✅ UEFI boot via Limine (protocol 0.6.5, **base revision 3**)
- ✅ **HBI v2.1** boot image packaging (`tools/hbi-gen` + `scripts/mkhbi.sh`)
  loaded as a Limine module; kernel parser in `huesos-kernel::boot::hbi`
- ✅ Physical memory manager: bitmap frame allocator over the real Limine
  memory map (not a hardcoded range); HBI image protected via `reserve_range`
- ✅ Paging: per-process address spaces (independent PML4, shared kernel
  upper half), kernel heap mapped through real page tables
- ✅ **HHDM base-rev-3 awareness**: ACPI/firmware tables and low AP trampoline
  pages are explicitly mapped (rev 3 does not put reserved/ACPI/MMIO into
  the HHDM and dropped the unconditional low 4 GiB identity map)
- ✅ GDT/TSS with real ring0/ring3 segments, IDT with page fault / GPF /
  double fault handlers
- ✅ Real `syscall`/`sysret` fast path (STAR/LSTAR/SFMASK), programmed
  **per logical CPU** (critical for user tasks migrated to APs)
- ✅ **SMP**: MADT parse, INIT-SIPI-SIPI, per-CPU GDT/TSS/IDT/CpuLocal
  (GS_BASE), per-CPU scheduler with idle task, shared LAPIC timer
  calibration, LAPIC EOI on vector 0x20, online-CPU load balancing, IPI
  reschedule on remote spawn
- ✅ Scheduler: Fair (CFS-like WAVL-tree) + Deadline (EDF) policies, not
  just plain round-robin
- ✅ Buddy + slab kernel heap (`huesos-alloc`, 128 MiB heap, `page_size`-aware)
- ✅ FAT16/32 driver crate (`huesos-fat`) with correct on-disk BPB layout
  and FAT16-aware end-of-chain
- ✅ ELF64 loader (`huesos-elf`) that maps `PT_LOAD` segments into a fresh
  address space
- ✅ Real ring3 userspace process (`huesos-init`) launched via `iretq`,
  built as a separate target and embedded at build time
- ✅ Dynamic userspace launch: init embeds child ELF images, creates
  processes/root VMARs, maps VMOs, creates threads, starts them, and
  receives bootstrap channels
- ✅ VMOs backed by real physical page frames
- ✅ Channel IPC with real connected pairs (`Channel::pair()`)
- ✅ PS/2 keyboard IRQ bridge to userspace via Interrupt objects + Ports
- ✅ Real framebuffer driver (`huesos-fb`) + `libcanvas` (safe syscall lib;
  userspace never maps raw video memory)

All of the above is exercised live by `huesos-init` on every boot — built
against `libcanvas` — which creates a VMO, does a channel round-trip,
mirrors logs to the framebuffer, then launches DriverManager and the
framebuffer terminal. DriverManager starts an `input-host` DriverHost,
registers the keyboard service, mounts a RAM BOOTFS image as
FileSystemService, and monitors heartbeats. The terminal paints via
`Canvas` and runs a built-in mini shell.

### QEMU multi-core smoke (expected)

```text
[HuesOS] Bootloader handed over control
[PMM] Reserved HBI image: ...
[SMP] MADT parsed 2 CPUs found
[SMP] LAPIC timer count=...
[SMP] Booting AP 1
[SMP] AP 1 online (waiting for release)
[SMP] AP 1 ready
[SMP] bringup done, APs ready=1
HBI v2.1 parsed. Entries: 0x4
[SMP] APs released to run
[SMP] AP 1 scheduling
HuesOS v0.1.0 on CPU 0
[init] hello from ring3 userspace, via libcanvas
[init] VMO read/write round-trip OK
[init] channel IPC round-trip OK
... driver-manager / terminal ready ...
```

Default `scripts/run.sh` uses `-smp 2`.

## Known Limitations

- No IOAPIC routing yet (LAPIC timer + legacy PIC keyboard path only)
- No filesystem on real block devices yet (BOOTFS is RAM; FAT crate is
  library-ready, not wired as the production VFS backend)
- Exited process address spaces / kernel task stacks are not yet reclaimed
  (zombie reaper is future work)
- Dynamic process launch is MVP: no full process wait/reap supervision
- No dynamic loading / relocations (static ELF only)
- Rights enforcement exists but isn't exhaustively audited
- Framebuffer text is ASCII-only (no Unicode shaping, by design)

## Hardware Compatibility

See [docs/HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md) for real-machine smoke-test notes.
Current reported bare-metal success includes an MSI Modern 15 B5M laptop.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the kernel (also builds and embeds the userspace init binary)
make build

# Build + package a bootable ISO + run in QEMU (UEFI/OVMF, 2 CPUs)
make run

# Release build
make run PROFILE=release

# Host-side unit tests (crates with hardware-independent logic)
make test
```

## Writing Your Own Userspace Program

See [docs/USERSPACE.md](docs/USERSPACE.md) — the short version: depend on
`libcanvas`, never call `syscall` yourself, and look at
`crates/huesos-userspace/init/src/main.rs` for a complete working example
(VMOs, channels, and framebuffer drawing).

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design
(including SMP, HBI, HHDM base-rev-3 mapping rules, and allocators).

## Building

See [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for prerequisites and build instructions.

## Testing

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for unit tests, multi-core QEMU
expectations, and CI setup.

## Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for planned improvements.
